        A tiny userscript adding the Play-All button back to YouTube.
    </p>
</div>

---

I got frustrated from not being able to binge-watch some YouTube channels. Unable to find a working userscript, I created this. Hopefully, it will be as useful to you as it is to me.

Also **works with YouTube Shorts** and supports the **mobile browser** version of YouTube.

or using the `Install` button.

## Usage

Once installed, you should be able to see the vibrant Play-All button when visiting or navigating to the videos section of a YouTube channel.
Simply clicking it or opening the link in a new tab will send you to the newest video playing inside the "Uploads from..." playlist.

It may take a few seconds for the button to be dynamically added.

### Playing Sorted By Most Popular

When sorting by most popular, the button will take you to the "Popular videos" playlist.
