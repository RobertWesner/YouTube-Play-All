        A tiny userscript adding the Play-All button back to YouTube.
    </p>
</div>

---

I got frustrated from not being able to binge-watch some YouTube channels. Unable to find a working userscript, I created this. Hopefully, it will be as useful to you as it is to me.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager. For example, [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/):
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)<br>
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)<br>
   - [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)<br>
   - [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)<br>

2. Install this userscript by clicking [this link](../../raw/main/script.user.js).

## Usage

Once installed, you should be able to see the vibrant Play-All button when visiting or navigating to the videos section of a YouTube channel.
Simply clicking it or opening the link in a new tab will send you to the newest video playing inside the "Uploads from..." playlist.

It may take a few seconds for the button to be dynamically added.
