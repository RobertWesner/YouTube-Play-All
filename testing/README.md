# YTPA Automated Testing

This is the puppeteer-enabled function-driven Purescript-based
testing environment for YTPA.

## Why

Reliability, stability, automating the tedious task of testing for UI problems on a real browser.

### Ok, but why Purescript?

No real reason.
One could throw out arguments like "FP being more stable", "Purescript being more reliable"...
I just like tha language and want to practice it.
